WF.Player.Core
==============

Core of a .Net Wherigo player.

To compile the core, you need a compiled version of the following libs:
- Eluant (https://github.com/WFoundation/Eluant) with native libraries for Lua or KopiLua (https://github.com/NLua/KopiLua)
- Newtonsoft.Json (https://github.com/ayoung/Newtonsoft.Json for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android, ... for WinPhone)

Put them into the lib directory.
